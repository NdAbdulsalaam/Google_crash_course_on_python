# DISCLAIMER

- This is the complete solution to coding exercises in `google crash on python` on coursera 

- The questions are as presented exactly in the course without any modification

- The purpose of this work is not to encourage lazziness but to **serve as a guide**

- It is, therefore, better that attempts are made before checking the solutions. That is, **this should be the last point of contact.**
